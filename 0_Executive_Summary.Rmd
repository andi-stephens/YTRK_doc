#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) resource in U.S. waters off the coast of the California, Oregon, and Washington using data through `r LastYR`.  

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) manages the U.S. fishery as two stocks separated at Cape Mendocino, California (40$^\circ$ 10'N). The northern stock has long been assessed on its own; the southern stock is treated as part of the Southern Shelf Complex.  This assessment analyzes each stock independently, with the southern stock extending southward to the U.S./Mexico border and the northern stock extending northward to the U.S./Canada border.

The most recent fully integrated assessment [@Wallace2005], following the pattern of prior assessments, included only the Northern stock which it divided into three assessment areas with divisions at Cape Elizabeth (47$^\circ$ 20'N) and Cape Falcon (45$^\circ$ 46'N).  A data-moderate assessment conducted in 2013 [@Cope2013] was the first to analyze the southern stock, determining its contribution to the overfishing limit (OFL) for the Southern Shelf Complex. 

Since the 2005 assessment, reconstruction of historical catch by Washington and Oregon makes any border but the state line (roughly 46$^\circ$ N) incompatible with the data from those states.  Additionally, much of the groundfish catch landed in northern Oregon is caught in Washington waters.  

This assessment addresses the stock in two areas consistent with the management border at Cape Mendocino.  This is consistent, as well, with a recent genetic analysis [@Hess2011] that found distinct stocks north and south of Cape Mendocino but did not find stock differences within the northern area. 


##Catches{-}
Catches from the Northern stock were divided into four categories: commercial catch, bycatch in the at-sea hake fishery, recreational catch in Oregon and California (north of 40$^\circ$ 10'N), and recreational catch in Washington. The first three of these fleets were entered in metric tons, but the recreational catch from Washington was entered in the model as numbers of fish with the average weight calculated internally in the model from the weight-length relationship and the length-compositions.

Catches from the Southern stock were divided into two categories: commercial and recreational catch, both of which were entered as metric tons.

##Data and Assessment{-}
\hl{Include: date of last assessment, type of assessment model, data available, new 
information, and information lacking.}

`r spp` was assessed north of Cape Mendocino in 2005 in a fully integrated age-based assessment. A 2013 data-moderate assessment was the first to address the southern stock [@Cope2013].  

This assessment uses Stock Synthesis version 3.3.  The Northern model begins in `r Dat_start_mod1`, with the assumption that the stock was at \hl{an unfished equilibrium that year?}  The Southern model begins in `r Dat_start_mod2`, with the assumption that the stock was at \hl{an unfished equilibrium that year?}

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were.....




##Reference Points{-}
\hl{Include:} management targets and definition of overfishing, including the harvest 
rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at $B_{40\%}$ (the $B_{MSY}$ proxy) and 
the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate 
(the $F_{MSY}$ proxy). Include a summary table that compares estimated reference 
points for SSB, SPR, Exploitation Rate and Yield based on SSBproxy for MSY, 
SPRproxy for MSY, and estimated MSY values

\hl{Write intro paragraph....and remove text for Models 2 and 3 if not needed}

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r mod1_label` are 
`r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the biomass 
target, but `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")` 
the minimum stock size threshold.  \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} 
The estimated relative depletion level for \hl{Model 1} in `r LastYR` is 
`r Depl_mod1` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`, corresponding 
to an unfished spawning output of `r paste(Spawn_mod1, fecund_unit,sep=' ')` 
(~95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(Spawn_mod1_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).  Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r Ref_pts_mod1[2,2]` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r paste(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, which gives 
a catch of `r Ref_pts_mod1[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt.

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r if(n_models>=2){mod2_label}` are 
`r if(n_models>=2){ifelse(Deplete_mod2[nrow(Deplete_mod2),2]-MT>0,"above","below")}` 
the biomass target, but `r if(n_models>=2){ifelse(Deplete_mod2[nrow(Deplete_mod2),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")}` 
the minimum stock size threshold. \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} The 
estimated relative depletion level for \hl{Model 2} in `r LastYR` is 
`r if(n_models>=2){Depl_mod2}` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 
`r if(n_models>=2){Depl_mod2_CI}`), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 
`r if(n_models>=2){paste(Spawn_mod2, fecund_unit, sep=' ')}` (~95% asymptotic interval: 
`r #paste(Spawn_mod2_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod2}). Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r if(n_models>=2){Ref_pts_mod2[2,2]}` 
mt in the base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r if(n_models>=2){paste(Ref_pts_mod2[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')}`, 
which gives a catch of `r #Ref_pts_mod2[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r if(n_models>=2){Ref_pts_mod2[15,2]}` mt.

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r if(n_models==3){mod3_label}` are 
`r if(n_models==3){ifelse(Deplete_mod3[nrow(Deplete_mod3),2]-MT>0,"above","below")}` 
the biomass target, but `r if(n_models==3){ifelse(Deplete_mod3[nrow(Deplete_mod3),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")}` 
the minimum stock size threshold. \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} The 
estimated relative depletion level or \hl{Model 3} in `r LastYR` is 
`r if(n_models==3){Depl_mod3}` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$
`r if(n_models==3){Depl_mod3_CI}`), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 
`r if(n_models==3){paste(Spawn_mod3, fecund_unit, sep=' ')}` (~95% asymptotic interval:
`r if(n_models==3){paste(Spawn_mod3_CI, fecund_unit,sep=' ')}`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod3}). Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r if(n_models==3){Ref_pts_mod3[2,2]}` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r if(n_models==3){paste(Ref_pts_mod3[7,2], fecund_unit, sep=' ')}`, which gives 
a catch of `r #Ref_pts_mod3[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r if(n_models==3){Ref_pts_mod3[15,2]}` mt.

##Research And Data Needs{-}
\hl{Include: identify information gaps that seriously impede the stock assessment.}    

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\begin{enumerate}

\item List item No. 1 in the list

\item List item No. 2 in the list, etc.

\end{enumerate}

##Rebuilding Projections{-}
\hl{Include: reference to the principal results from rebuilding analysis if the 
stock is overfished. This section should be included in the Final/SAFE version 
assessment document but is not required for draft assessments undergoing review. 
See Rebuilding Analysis terms of reference for detailed information on 
rebuilding analysis requirements.}
