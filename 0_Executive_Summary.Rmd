#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) resource in U.S. waters off the coast of the California, Oregon, and Washington using data through `r LastYR`.  

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) manages the U.S. fishery as two stocks separated at Cape Mendocino, California (40$^\circ$ 10'N). The northern stock has long been assessed on its own; the southern stock is managed as part of the "Minor Shelf Rockfish" complex.  This assessment analyzes each stock independently, with the southern stock extending southward to the U.S./Mexico border and the northern stock extending northward to the U.S./Canada border (Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map_Exec_Sum}).

![Map depicting the boundaries for the base-case model.  \label{fig:assess_region_map_Exec_Sum}](Figures/assess_region_map_v2.png)

The most recent fully integrated assessment [@Wallace2005], following the pattern of prior assessments, included only the Northern stock which it divided into three assessment areas with divisions at Cape Elizabeth (47$^\circ$ 20'N) and Cape Falcon (45$^\circ$ 46'N).  A data-moderate assessment conducted in 2013 [@Cope2013] was the first to analyze the southern stock, determining its contribution to the overfishing limit (OFL) for the Southern Shelf Complex. 

Since the 2005 assessment, reconstruction of historical catch by Washington and Oregon makes any border but the state line (roughly 46$^\circ$ N) incompatible with the data from those states.  Additionally, much of the groundfish catch landed in northern Oregon is caught in Washington waters.  

This assessment addresses the stock in two areas consistent with the management border at Cape Mendocino.  This is consistent, as well, with a recent genetic analysis [@Hess2011] that found distinct stocks north and south of Cape Mendocino but did not find stock differences within the northern area.

##Catches{-}
Catches from the Northern stock (Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catch_N}) were divided into four categories: commercial catch, bycatch in the at-sea hake fishery, recreational catch in Oregon and California (north of 40$^\circ$ 10'N), and recreational catch in Washington. The first three of these fleets were entered in metric tons, but the recreational catch from Washington was entered in the model as numbers of fish with the average weight calculated internally in the model from the weight-length relationship and the estimated selectivity for this fleet (which is informed by the length-compositions). Catches have been increasing over the past 10 years (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch_N}) but remain well below the peak catch due to management measures, included lower catch limits and closed areas.

Catches from the Southern stock (Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catch_S}) were divided into two categories: commercial and recreational catch, both of which were entered as metric tons. Catches over the past 10 years have remained far below the peak levels, with the majority of recent catch coming from the Recreational fishery (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch_S})

##Data and Assessment{-}
`r spp` north of Cape Mendocino (40$^\circ$ 10'N) was most recently assessed as part of a 2013 data-moderate stock assessment [@Cope2013] that did not include any length or age data. The northern stock was previously assessed in 2000 [@Tagart2000] with that assessment updated in 2003 and 2005 [@Lai2003, @Wallace2005]. The stock south of 40$^\circ$ 10'N has never been assessed due to a percieved lack of data in this area.

This assessment uses Stock Synthesis version 3.3.  The Northern model begins in `r Dat_start_mod1`. The Southern model begins in `r Dat_start_mod2`. In both cases those starting years were chosen based on the first year of the available catch data and the start of the estimated recruitment deviations was at a later point, so both models were assumed to start at an unfished equilibrium.
 
##Stock Biomass{-}
The spawning output for the Northern model was estimated to have fallen below 40\% of unifished equilibrium in the early 1980s, to a minimum of `r MinDepl_mod1`% in `r MinDeplYr_mod1` but has rebounded since to `r Depl_mod1` in 2017 (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`) (Figures \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}, Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}).

The spawning output for the Southern model is estimated to have experienced less impact from fishing and never fallen below the 40\% reference point. The estimated minimum was `r MinDepl_mod2`% in `r MinDeplYr_mod2` and the estimated relative spawning output in 2017 is `r Depl_mod2` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod2_CI`).

##Recruitment{-}
Recruitment is estimated to be at a similar scale for both models (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all}) except for the final years in which the Southern model is estimated to have had very large recruitments in 2008 and 2010 (Tables \ref{tab:Recruit_mod1} and \ref{tab:Recruit_mod2}). The Southern model has higher mortality but slower growth than the Northern model, leading to a larger level of recruitment relative to the spawning output in the South.

##Exploitation status{-}
The Northern model is estimated to have experienced overfishing throughout the 1980s and 1990s relative to the current SPR-based harvest limits (Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). The Southern stock is managed as part of a stock complex under catch limits applied at the complex level. However, the fishing intensity is estimated to have remained below 100% for all years. In recent years, the fishing intensity has been well within the management limits for both areas with particularly low estimates for the Southern model (Tables \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod2}).

A summary of `r spp` exploitation histories for base model is provided as Figure \ref{fig:Phase_all}.

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
Rockfish in general are sensitive to the strength and timing of the upwelling cycle in the Eastern Pacific, which affects where pelagic juveniles settle, and impacts the availability of the zooplankton which the young require.

Yellowtail rockfish feed mainly on pelagic animals, but are opportunistic, occasionally eating benthic animals as well. Large juveniles and adults eat fish (small Pacific whiting, Pacific herring, smelt, anchovies, lanternfishes, and others), along with squid, krill, and other planktonic organisms.  They are prey for Chinook salmon, lingcod, cormorants, pigeon guillemots and rhinoceros auklets. [@Love2011]




##Reference Points{-}
Yellowtail rockfish are managed relative to biomass reference points at $B_{40\%}$ (the $B_{MSY}$ proxy) and $B_{25\%}$ (the minimum stock-size threshold). Harvest rates are managed relative to an $F_{MSY}$ proxy $SPR = 50\%$ which corresponds to a Relative Fishing Intensity, $(1 - {SPR})/(1 - {SPR}_{50\%})$, of 100\%. This assessment estimates both the Northern and Southern stocks to be above the $B_{40\%}$ threshold with Relative Fishing Intensity below 100\% (${SPR} > 50\%$ which means the Spawning Potential is greater than 50\% of the unfished Spawning Potential).

The estimated relative depletion level for the Northern model in 2017 is 
`r Depl_mod1` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`, corresponding 
to an unfished spawning output of `r paste(round(Spawn_mod1,1), fecund_unit,sep=' ')` 
(~95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(Spawn_mod1_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).  Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r Ref_pts_mod1[2,2]` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r paste(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, which gives 
a catch of `r Ref_pts_mod1[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt.

The estimated relative depletion level for the Southern model in 2017 is 
`r {Depl_mod2}` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ 
`r {Depl_mod2_CI}`), corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 
`r {paste(round(Spawn_mod2,1), fecund_unit, sep=' ')}` (~95% asymptotic interval: 
`r #paste(Spawn_mod2_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod2}). Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r {Ref_pts_mod2[2,2]}` 
mt in the base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r {paste(Ref_pts_mod2[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')}`, 
which gives a catch of `r Ref_pts_mod2[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r {Ref_pts_mod2[15,2]}` mt.

Estimated equilibrium yield curves for both models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all}.

##Management Performance{-}

Total catch (including landings and discards) from the Northern stock has remained well below the management limits in recent years (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform.N}) and harvest specifications for 2017 and 2018 are set at values similar to the previous years.

The southern stock has been managed in the Southern Shelf Rockfish complex so is not managed under a single-species catch limit. Nevertheless, the contribution of the yellowtail stock to the reference points for the complex are shown in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform.S}, indicating that recent catches have been well below the OFL contributions in spite of these limits not being used in managing fisheries catches.

##Research And Data Needs{-}
We recommend the following research will be valuable for future `r spp` assessments:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A longer timeseries of the juvenile rockfish CPUE in the south.

\item A commercial index in the north.  This is by far the largest segment of the fishery, and the introduction of the trawl rationalization program should mean that an index can be developed for the current fishery when the next assessment is performed.

\item More recent ages for the southern model.  The commercial age timeseries currently stops in 2002. Otoliths have been collected for all years in the Hook \& Line survey but only samples from 2004 have been aged.


\end{enumerate}

##Rebuilding Projections{-}
\hl{Include: reference to the principal results from rebuilding analysis if the 
stock is overfished. This section should be included in the Final/SAFE version 
assessment document but is not required for draft assessments undergoing review.
