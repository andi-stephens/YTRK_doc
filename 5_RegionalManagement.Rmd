#Regional Management Considerations

Management of the Yellowtail Rockfish northern stock has always been delineated by the 40$^\circ$ 10' line and the Canadian border.  That the stock's genetic cline was found at Cape Mendocino is a happy accident that reinforces 40$^\circ$ 10' as the appropriate management line.

This assessment was not designed to test that choice.  Given that the data for commercial and recreational fisheries is collected by the individual states (WA, OR, CA), it might have been interesting to investigate a management line at the California/Oregon border, had the STAT team the time and managers the interest in investigating a change.
