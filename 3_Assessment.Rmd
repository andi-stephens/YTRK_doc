##History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This Stock

###Previous Assessments

###Previous Assessment Recommendations
Include: Response to STAR panel recommendations from the most recent previous 
assessment.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: blah blah blah.] \hfill \\

   STAT response: blah blah blah....

\item[Recommendation 2: blah blah blah.] \hfill \\

  STAT response: blah blah blah....

\item[Recommendation 3: blah blah blah., etc.] \hfill \\

  STAT response: Continue recommendations as needed

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
##Model Description


###Transition To The Current Stock Assessment
Include: Complete description of any new modeling approaches

Below, we describe the most important changes made since the last full assessment 
and explain rationale for each change.:

1. Change No. 1. \emph{Rationale}: blah blah blah.

2. Change No. 2.  \emph{Rationale}: blah blah blah.

3. Change No. 3.  \emph{Rationale}:  Continue list as needed.



###Definition of Fleets and Areas
We generated data sources for each of the models.  Fleets by model include:


**Model Region 1 or remove this line if only one model** 

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleets include...   

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleets include...

\emph{Research}: Research derived-data include...



###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas



###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.24u by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version (SS-V3.24u) was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.

###Data Weighting
Citation for Francis method [@Francis2011]      
Citation for Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]



###Priors
Citation for Hamel prior on natural mortality [@Hamel2015]


###General Model Specifications
Citation for posterior predictive fecundity relationship from Dick [-@Dick2009]     
Model data, control, starter, and forecast files can be found in Appendices A-D.


###Estimated And Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables....
Estimated and fixed parameters tables currently read in from .csv file, 
EXAMPLE: Table \ref{tab:Model1_params}


##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices
Include: Evidence of search for balance between model realism and parsimony.  
Comparison of key model assumptions, include comparisons based on nested models 
(e.g., asymptotic vs. domed selectivities, constant vs. time-varying selectivities).  



###Alternate Models Considered
Include: Summary of alternate model configurations that were tried but rejected.



###Convergence
Include: Randomization run results or other evidence of search for global 
best estimates.    

Convergence testing through use of dispersed starting values often requires 
extreme values to actually explore new areas of the multivariate likelihood 
surface. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a 
normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range 
[@Methot2015]. Table \ref{tab:jitter} shows the results of running 100 jitters 
for each pre-STAR base model....

Intro sentence or two....(Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}). 

Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ harvest rate corresponding to 
$SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt.  Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} 
shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the northern area model 
and Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all} shows the equilibrium yield curve.
