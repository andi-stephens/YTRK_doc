<!-- ***********HISTORY AND CURRENT ASSESSMENT***************************** -->
##History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This Stock

Yellowtail rockfish was previously modeled as ag age-structured, 3-area stock north of  $40^\circ 10^\prime$  in 1999 [@Tagart2000] using a model written in ADMB [@Fournier2012]; an update of this assessment was last conducted in 2004 [@Wallace2005].  That assessment divided the stock into 3 INPFC areas which are not coincident with state boundaries; this is a concern in that recent reconstructions of historical catch are state-by-state along the West Coast.  Because we cannot produce data that conform to the areas previously assessed, we have made no effort to reproduce the previous model.

A data-moderate approach was used to evaluate stock status in 2013 [@Cope2013].  This approach is not compatible with the current model, and we have made no attempt to reproduce it.

###Previous Assessment Recommendations

Many of the recommendations of the previous STAR panel are not relevant to this assessment, as they related to data deficiencies at that time that have since been resolved.  The 2004 STAR particularly recommended a focus on abundance indices, which they noted might require further survey information.

This assessment provides four indices for the Northern model, and three for the Southern model.  All indices are newly developed for this analysis.

##Model Description


###Transition To The Current Stock Assessment
These are the main changes from the previous model, and our rationale for them:

1. Transition to Stock Synthesis. \emph{Rationale}: The Pacific Fishery Management Council's preferred modeling platform for stock assessments is Stock Synthesis [@Methot2015], developed since the last full assessment of yellowtail rockfish.

2. Addition of Southern model. \emph{Rationale}: Hess, et al. determined that the West Coast yellowtail stocks show a genetic cline occurring near Cape Mendocino, which is roughly  $40^\circ 10^\prime$ north latitude [@Hess2011].  This divides the stock into two genetically distinct substocks which we model independently.

2. Availability of recent data. \emph{Rationale}: Ten years of data collection have occurred since the last update assessment, and the data necessary for an assessment of the Southern stock is now available.

3. Historical catch reconstructions. \emph{Rationale}:  Reconstruction of catch timeseries in California, Washington and Oregon clarify stock history as far back as 1889.


###Definition of Fleets and Areas

The Northern model comprises the area between Cape Mendocino, California, and the Canadian border.  The Southern model runs from Cape Mendocino to the Mexican border.

**Northern Model** 

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of bottom and midwater trawl.  No attempt was made to analyze the fishery separately by gear, particularly since it seems that in the fishery in the 1980s and 1990s, "bottom trawl" gear was used in the midwater as well as on the bottom, and "midwater gear" was sometimes dragged across soft bottom (Craig Goode, ODFW Port Sampler, pers. comm).

The data associated with the commercial fleet includes age- and length-composition data from PacFIN and CalCOM, historical catch timeseries from CDFW, ODFW and WDFW, and observations from the West Coast Groundfish Observing Program (**WCGOP**), which documents discarding in the commercial fishery (providing discard lengths), as well as discard rates calculated from WCGOP data.  Sex was available for the comps in the retained catch, which is by-sex in the model, but was not available for the discards, so they are undifferentiated by sex.

The PacFIN logbook (fish ticket) index developed for the commercial fishery is in fish/tow.

\emph{At-Sea Hake Fishery}: Yellowtail Rockfish are frequently caught in mid-water trawls associated with the At-Sea Hake Fishery (consisting of the Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors). These catches are recorded and biological sampling takes place but the fish are processed at sea (typically into fish meal) and are not included in the PacFIN database, so this fishery requires separate analysis.  The At-Sea Hake fishery provides catches, length compositions by sex, and an index of abundance.

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport fisheries off Oregon, and northern California (Eureka and Del Norte counties), from MRFSS and RecFIN.  The index of abundance for the recreational fleet is in fish per angler-hour.  Length data for this fleet are undifferentiated by sex.

\emph{Washington-Sport}:  The Washington data (WA_Sport) provides catches, lengths and ages, and was treated as a separate fleet for two reasons:  first, the length composition of the Washington catches were different from those in the recreational landings in Oregon and northern California (MRFSS/RecFIN data).  There are very large fish in this dataset, and fewer small ones.  Second, the WA_Sport landings are not available by weight, so they are entered in the model as numbers, and Stock Synthesis internally converts them to weight, using the percentages-at-length and the Weight-Length relationship.  Sex was available for the biological data, however many lengthed fish were not sexed, so the lengths for this fleet are undifferentiated by sex, although the ages are.

\emph{Research}: Research fleets (3).
The Alaska Fisheries Science Center's **Triennial** Trawl survey, and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's **NWFSCcombo** survey each provide age- and length-compositions, as well as an index of abundance.

The remaining research fleet is the **Pikitch study**, which provides discard length-compositions and an index of abundance.

\emph{Conditional Age-at-Length}:  Only the NWFSCcombo ages were used as conditional age-at-length in the model.  All other aged fleets (Commercial, Washington\_Sport, and Triennial) are present in the model as marginal ages due to the amount of noise in the age data for those fleets.

\emph{Indices}:  Fish per angler-hour is the basis for the Washington\_Sport and Pikitch indices.  The NWFSCcombo and Triennial surveys provide indices based on fish per area-towed.  The logbook survey for the commercial fleet is in units of fish per tow.

**Southern Model**

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of hook and line and trawl gear.  Hook and line gear account for 78% of the landings by weight in the recent period (1978-2016).  Commercial data were sexed, although there are many unsexed lengths.  To preserve the large numbers of lengths, the length data are entered in the model as undifferentiated, however the ages are sexed and provide the sole conditional age-at-length timeseries in the Southern Model.

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport fishery off the California coast south of Cape Mendocino.  The recreational lengths are unsexed.  The index is in fish per angler_hour.

\emph{California Onbord Recreational Survey}: Research derived-data include observations from the California Onboard recreational survey.  The length-compositions from this survey are undifferentiated by sex.  The index is in fish per angler_hour.

\emph{NWFSC Hook-and-Line Survey}:  The data from this survey are used in the model as an index of fish per angler_hour, a single year of marginal age data by sex, and sexed length compositions.

\emph{Small Fish Study}: A separate index, length comps and a single year of ages reflect a small study of juvenile fish conducted by the SWFSC.


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3[@Methot2015], which is the Pacific Fishery Management Council's preferred modeling platform for assessments.

###Data Weighting

Commercial and survey length composition and marginal age composition data are weighted according to the method of Ian Stewart (pers.comm):

   Sample Size = 0.138 * Nfish + Ntows if Nfish/Ntows < 44, and Ntows * 7.06 otherwise.

Age-at-Length samples are unwieghted; that is, each fish is assumed to represent an independent sample.

Recreational trips (the analogue of tows in the commercial fishery) are difficult to define in most cases.  Since much of the recreational data are from the dockside interview MRFSS program, which didn't anticipate the need to delineate samples as belonging to particular trips, we chose to use all recreational data "as-is", with the initial weights entered as number of fish.

Weighting among fleets uses either the Francis method [@Francis2011] or the Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997].  The Francis method was used for all fleets, except for the age data from the Southern model's Hook and Line survey, which is a single year of data to which we applied the Ianelli-McAllister method.


###Priors
Natural Mortality (M) priors were provided by Owen Hamel [@Hamel2015].  Natural mortality priors were based on examination of the 99\% quantile of the observed ages from early in the time-series, before the full impact of fishing would have taken place. For the Northern model, these quantiles were approximately 35 years for females and 45 years for males, resulting in median M values of 0.15 and 0.12 for females and males. For the Southern model, the 99\% quantile of the early age observations were approximately 30 and 40 years for females and males, resulting in median M prior values of 0.18 and 0.135, respectively. In both models, M for males was represented as an offset from females. In the Northern model, both the female value and the male offset could be estimated without priors so the priors were not used. For the southern model, M was fixed at the median prior values for the two sexes.

The prior for steepness (h, 0.718) was provided by James Thorson and used as a fixed parameter in both models. <TOADS:  Citation>

##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

Selectivity in both models is asymptotic, with the exception of the OR-CA MRFSS recreational fleet in the Northern model, and the Onboard recreational fleet in the Southern model.

###Alternate Models Considered
Time-blocked selectivity and retention were investigated in the Northern model, as were domed selectivities.

We also explored time-blocks on selectivity in the Southern model, and domed selectivity for the MRFSS/RecFIN data.

These approaches resulted in model fits to data that were obviously poor, and so they were rejected

###Convergence
Convergence testing through use of dispersed starting values often requires extreme values to explore new areas of the multivariate likelihood surface. Stock Synthesis provides a jitter option that generates random starting values from a normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range [@Methot2015]. We used this function to find parameter values for convergence in the Southern model.  The Northern model did not require jittering.

## Northern Model Base Case Results

### Indices and Discards

Selectivities in the Northern model \ref{fig:selex_model1} shows the difference between the recreational fisheries and the commercial fishery and survey sampling.  All of the fish are fully selected by 50 cm, but the recreational fish are fully selected at 30 cm.

Retention by length \ref{fig: retention_model1} varies over time between 40\% and 100\%, with no clear pattern of interannual variation, except for the trawl-rationalization era 2011-present.

Discarding in the commercial fleet \ref{fig:r4ss_discard_model1} is fit only by putting blocks on retention in the Northern model.  Discards were very low except during the 1990s and 2000s, until the trawl-rationalization program implementation.

Fits to the indices for the northern model demonstrate the utility of the NWFSCcombo survey.  Although the model misses the uptick at the end of the timeseries, it is the only recent index and is well-fit by the model.  The other indices are noisier.  Most of the indices are fairly flat, indicating little change in abundance during each time-period.  Although the fit to the Triennial index is poor, the data nicely reflects the changes in management during it's tenure:  the CPUE was falling during the 1980s and 1990s, then rising after stringent restrictions began in 2000.

### Lengths
Bubble plots for the lengths in the fishery \ref{fig:comp_length_bubble_mod1_page1} show the constancy of the commercial fleet, and the differences in growth between males and females; the females are larger, the males smaller.  The recreational fleet is represented by two different sampling regimes, and the changeover in the mid-2000s is clear in that panel.  That the WA\_Sport fishery catches larger fish is represented in the large bubbles at the top of the panel.  Had we examined that fishery earlier in the process of putting the model together, we might have settled on a larger maximum size bin, however that fishery remains the smallest portion of the catches.

Commercial length comps are very well fit \ref{fig:xxx}, and \ref{fig:mod1_5_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_xxx}.  Commercial discards are noiser and not well fit \ref{fig:mod1_6_comp_lenfxxx}.  The panel describing the combined fits and data weighting for the commercial fishery is duplicted, need to remove redundant figure.

Lengths in the early period of the Hake Bycatch fishery are noisy (doubtless due to small sample sizes).  By 1992, the model is able to fit the data well \ref{fig:mod1_10_comp_xxx}.  \ref{fig:mod1_13_comp_lenfit_data_weighting} shows that the fits in the early period have twice (at last) the uncertainty of the later period.

The recreation OR+N.CA timeseries of lengths demonstrates the difference between the MRFSS sampling and RecFIN sampling.  The fits in the early period are good, those in the later period are noisy and model uncertainty is high \ref{fig:mod1_14_comp_l} and \ref{}

The WA_Sport length fits might have been improved with a better choice of maximum size bin for the model \ref{fig:mod1_18_comp_lenf}; \ref{fig:mod1_21_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Recreational} however the data are noisy throughout the size range represented.

The Trinnial lengths \ref{fig:mod1_22_comp_len} and \ref{fig:mod1_25_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Triennial Survey} are fit well in some years and not in others.  The data is not noisy, however the intermittency of data collection may mean that the model is unable to capture interannual variation as well as for an annual timeseries.

NWFSCcombo lengths are not well fit, particularly in 2013, where the data show a large number of small fit that may represent a good recruitment several years earlier \ref{fig:mod1_26_comp_len} and \ref{fig:mod1_29_comp_lenfit_data_weighting}.

\ref{fig:mod1_30_comp_lenfit__aggregated_across_time} shows the relative fits among the data sources.  The timeseries of presence-absence residuals indicated by filled- and open-bubbles \ref{fig:comp_Pearson_length_mod1_page1} and \ref{fig:comp_Pearson_length_mod1_page2} demonstrates the relative disappointment in model fits; the smaller the bubble, the better the match between the data and the model expectation.

### Ages

The NWFSCcombo survey provided the only source of conditional age-at-length data for the Northern model; ages for other fleets were treated as marginal ages.

##Southern Model

One thing to point out is that although the scale of the biomass in the model is somewhat sensitive to various data sources, the depletion is not.  In tuning the model we were suprised to note that depletion always stayed above 80\%.
