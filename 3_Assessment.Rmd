##History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This Stock

Yellowtail rockfish was previously modeled as a 3-area stock north of 40.10 using a model written in ADMB <TOADS> need citation in 1999. <TOADS> Need citation, with an update assessment in 2004[@Wallace2005].  That assessment divided the stock into 3 INPFC areas which are not coincident with state boundaries; this is a concern in that recent reconstructions of historical catch are state-by-state along the West Coast.  Because we cannot produce data that conform to the areas previously assessed, we have made no effort to reproduce the previous model.


###Previous Assessment Recommendations

Many of the recommendations of the previous STAR panel are not relevant to this assessment, as they related to data deficiencies at that time that have since been resolved.  The 2004 STAR particularly recommended a focus on abundance indices, which they noted might require further survey information.

This assessment provides four indices for the Northern model, and three for the Southern model.  All indices are newly developed for this analysis.

##Model Description


###Transition To The Current Stock Assessment
These are the main changes from the previous model, and our rationale for them:

1. Transition to Stock Synthesis. \emph{Rationale}: The Pacific Fishery Management Council's preferred modeling platform for stock assessments is Stock Synthesis [@Methot2015], developed since the last full assessment of yellowtail rockfish.

2. Addition of Southern model. \emph{Rationale}: Hess, et al. determined that the West Coast yellowtail stocks show a genetic cline occurring near Cape Mendocino, which is roughly 40.10 north latitude [@Hess2011].  This divides the stock into two genetically distinct substocks which we model independently.

2. Availability of recent data. \emph{Rationale}: Ten years of data collection have occurred since the last update assessment, and the data necessary for an assessment of the Southern stock is now available.

3. Historical catch reconstructions. \emph{Rationale}:  Reconstruction of catch timeseries in California, Washington and Oregon clarify stock history as far back as 1898.


###Definition of Fleets and Areas


**Northern Model** 

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of bottom and midwater trawl.  No attempt was made to analyze the fishery separately by gear, particularly since it seems that in the fishery in the 1980s and 1990s, "bottom trawl" gear was used in the midwater as well as on the bottom, and "midwater gear" was sometimes dragged across soft bottoms (Craig Goode, ODFW Port Sampler, pers. comm).

\emph{At-Sea Hake Fishery}: Yellowtail Rockfish are frequently caught in mid-water trawls associated with the At-Sea Hake Fishery (consisting of the Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors). These catches are recorded and biological sampling takes place but the fish are processed at sea (typically into fish meal) and are not included in the PacFIN database so require separate analysis.

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and northern California (Eureka and Del Norte counties)

\emph{Research}: Research derived-data include observations from the West Coast Groundfish Observing Program (WCGOP) which documents discarding in the commercial fishery, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Triennial Trawl survey, and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's NWFSCcombo survey.

**Southern Model**

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of hook and line and trawl gear.  Hook and line gear account for 78% of the landings by weight in the recent period (1978-2016).

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport fishery off the California coast south of Cape Mendocino.

\emph{Research}: Research derived-data include observations from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's NWFSCcombo survey, and California Onboard recreational survey.


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3[@Methot2015].

###Data Weighting

Commercial and survey length composition and marginal age composition data are weighted according to the method of Ian Stewart (pers.comm):

   Sample Size = 0.138 * Nfish + Ntows if Nfish/Ntows < 44, and Ntows * 7.06 otherwise.

Age-at-Length samples are unwieghted; that is, each fish is assumed to represent an independent sample.

Recreational trips (the analogue of tows in the commercial fishery) are difficult to define in most cases.  Since much of the recreational data are from the dockside interview MRFSS program, which didn't anticipate the need to delineate samples as belonging to particular trips, we chose to use all recreational data "as-is", with the initial weights entered as number of fish.

Weighting among fleets uses either the Francis method [@Francis2011] or the Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997].  The Francis method was used for all fleets, except for the age data from the Southern model's Hook and Line survey, which is a single year of data to which we applied the Ianelli-McAllister method.


###Priors
Natural Mortality (M) priors were provide by Owen Hamel prior on natural mortality [@Hamel2015].  Natural mortality priors were based on examination of 99\% quantile of the observed ages early in the time-series before the full impact of fishing would have taken place. For the Northern model, these quantiles were approximately 35 years for females and 45 years for males, resulting in median M values of 0.15 and 0.12 for females and males. For the Southern model, the 99\% quantile of the early age observations were approximately 30 and 40 years for females and males, resulting in median M prior values of 0.18 and 0.135, respectively. In both models, M for males was represented as an offset from females. In the Northern model, both the female value and the male offset could be estimated without priors so the priors were not used. For the southern model, M was fixed at the median prior values for the two sexes.

The prior for steepness (h, 0.718) was provided by James Thorson and used as a fixed parameter in both models. <TOADS:  Citation>

##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

Selectivity in both models is asymptotic, with the exception of the OR-CA MRFSS recreational fleet in the Northern model, and the Onboard recreational fleet in the Southern model.

###Alternate Models Considered
Time-blocked selectivity and retention were investigated in the Northern model, as were domed selectivities.

We also explored time-blocks on selectivity in the Southern model, and domed selectivity for the MRFSS/RecFIN data.

These approaches resulted in model fits to data that were obviously poor, and so they were rejected

###Convergence

<TOADS> Boilerplate, revisit:

Convergence testing through use of dispersed starting values often requires 
extreme values to actually explore new areas of the multivariate likelihood 
surface. Jitter is a Stock Synthesis option that generates random starting values from a 
normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range 
[@Methot2015]. Table \ref{tab:jitter} shows the results of running 100 jitters 
for each pre-STAR base model....
