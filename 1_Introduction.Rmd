#Introduction

##Basic Information
Yellowtail rockfish, *Sebastes flavidus*, occur off the West Coast of the US from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.  Once thought to comprise a single stock, a recent genetic study has shown them to be two sub-species, with a genetic cline at Cape Mendocino, California, roughly 40-10 North Latitude[@Hess2011].  Yellowtail rockfish is an aggregating, midwater species usually caught between 60 and 120 fathoms.  Off Washington and Oregon, yellowtail are largely caught in the commercial trawl fishery; in California there is a large recreational fishery for yellowtail.  They are colloquially known as "greenies", although *flavidus* is Latin for "yellow"[@Love2011].


##Map
A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or 
data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}.

##Life History
Yellowtail rockfish are among those that are fertilized internally and release live young.  Spawning aggregations occur in the fall, and parturition in the winter and spring (January-May)[@Eldridge1990].  Young-of-the-year recruit to nearshore waters from April through August, migrating to deeper water in the fall.  Preferred habitat is the midwater over reefs and boulder fields.  They are extremely motile, and make rapid and frequent ascents and descents of 40 meters; they also exhibit strong homing tendencies.[@Love2011].  They are able to quickly release gas from their swim bladders, perhaps making them less susceptible to barotrauma than similar species[@Eldridge1990].


##Fishery Information
The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast first developed 
off California in the late 19th century as a hook-and-line fishery [@Love2002].  
The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United 
States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created 
an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961].

Today yellowtail remains a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from Central California to British Columbia[@Love2011].


##Summary of Management History
Yellowtail rockfish co-occur with canary, widow rockfish and several other rockfishes (Nagtegaal
1983; Tagart 1987; Rogers and Pikitch 1992). Association with these and other rockfish species
has substantially altered fishing opportunity for yellowtail rockfish. Canary rockfish stocks are
currently at very low levels of abundance and have been declared overfished by National Marine
Fisheries service. In order to achieve the necessary reduction in the canary rockfish catch, the
Council adopted stringent management measures in 2000. Harvest of canary rockfish and their
co-occurring species was limited.

Beginning in 2000, shelf rockfish species (including yellowtail) could no longer be retained by
vessels using bottom trawl footropes with a diameter of greater than 8 inches. The use of small
footrope gear increases the risk of gear loss in rocky areas. This restriction was intended to
provide an incentive for fishers to avoid high-relief, rocky habitat, thus reducing the exposure of
many depleted species to trawling. This incentive was reinforced through reductions in landing
limits for most shelf rockfish species.

Since September 2002, managers have employed closed areas, referred to as Rockfish
Conservation Areas (RCAÃ­s), in addition to landings limits and gear restrictions. The boundaries
of the northern trawl RCA, delineated by waypoints approximating depth contours, have varied
between and within years. The seaward boundary of the trawl RCA has ranged from 150-250 fm,
while the shoreward boundary has ranged from 100 fm to the shore. Following implementation
of this closed area, only small footrope gear could be used shoreward of the RCA. Beginning in
2005, additional gear restrictions were imposed in the northern area. Based on several years of
testing and evaluation, a more flatfish-selective net design is now required for use in waters
shoreward of the RCA.

Since the end of 2002, there have been no landings limits that provide directed mid-water fishing
opportunities for yellowtail rockfish. From 2001 through 2004, yellowtail rockfish could be
landed in amounts up to one-third the weight of most flatfish onboard (not to exceed 7,500 lb/trip
or 15,000 lb/2-months). With the requirement to use selective flatfish gear in 2005, the yellowtail
allowance was reduced to 2,000 lb/2-month period.

##Fisheries off Canada, Alaska, and/or Mexico
Limited fishing for yellowtail occurs as far south as Baja California[@Love2011].  The 2015 Stock Assessment conducted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) found the stock to be at 0.49B0, in the "healthy" range.
