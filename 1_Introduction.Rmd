#Introduction

##Basic Information
\hl{Include: Scientific name, distribution, the basis of the choice of stock structure, 
including regional differences in life history or other biological characteristics 
that should form the basis of management units.}

##Map
A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or 
data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:boundary_map}.

##Life History
\hl{Include: Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, 
sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).}

##Ecosystem Considerations
\hl{Include: Ecosystem considerations (e.g., ecosystem role and trophic relationships of 
the species, habitat requirements/preferences, relevant data on ecosystem processes 
that may affect stock or parameters used in the stock assessment, and/or cross-FMP 
interactions with other fisheries). This section should note if environmental 
correlations or food web interactions were incorporated into the assessment model. 
The length and depth of this section would depend on availability of data and reports 
from the IEA, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors are informational 
to contribute quantitative information to the assessment.}



##Fishery Information
\hl{Include: Important features of current fishery and relevant history of fishery.}

Rockfish example: The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast first developed 
off California in the late 19th century as a hook-and-line fishery [@Love2002].  
The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United 
States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created 
an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961]. Etc....


##Summary of Management History
\hl{Include: Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip 
limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, 
catch rates, or discards).}


##Management Performance
\hl{Include: Management performance, including a table or tables comparing 
Overfishing Limit (OFL), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), Harvest Guideline (HG) 
[CPS only], landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year.}

Management performance table: (Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform})      
A summary of these values as well as other base case summary results can be found 
in Table \ref{tab:base_summary}.


##Fisheries off Canada, Alaska, and/or Mexico
Include if necessary.
