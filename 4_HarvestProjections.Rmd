#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
Potential OFL projections for each model are shown in Table \ref{tab:Forecast_mod1} for the Northern model and Table \ref{tab:Forecast_mod2} for the Southern model.

These values can be compared to recent regulations shown in Tables \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform.N} and \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform.S}.

Decision tables will be completed during the STAR panel after determination of the axis of uncertainty and catch streams to include.
