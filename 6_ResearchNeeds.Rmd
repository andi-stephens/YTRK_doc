#Research and Data Needs

The following research will be valuable for future `r spp` assessments:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A hindrance to analysis of the commercial fishery is the inability to distinguish between midwater and trawl gear, particularly in the 1980s-1990s.  Reliable recording of gear type will ensure that this does not continue to be problematic for future assessments.

\item We recommend that the next assessment of the Northern stock be an update to this assessment, unless fishing patterns change dramatically, or new sources of data are discovered.

\item For the next full assessment, we suggest the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A commercial index in the North.  This is by far the largest segment of the fishery, and the introduction of the trawl rationalization program should mean that an index can be developed for the current fishery when the next full assessment is performed.

\item Further analysis of growth patterns along the Northern coast.  The previous full assessment subdivided the Northern stock based on research showing differential growth along the coast, and although data for the assessment is no longer available along the INPFC areas used in that analysis, there may be some evidence of growth variability that would be useful to include in a future assessment.

\end{itemize}

\item The Southern stock cannot be evaluated with a full statistical catch-at-age model unless more data are made available. In particular, we feel that the following are minimally required:

\begin{itemize}
\item A longer timeseries of the juvenile rockfish CPUE in the south, which will of course only be available after several years have elapsed..

\item A timeseries of recent ages for the Southern model.  The commercial age timeseries currently stops in 2002. Otoliths have been collected for all years in the Hook \& Line survey, however only samples from 2004 have been aged.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
