\subsection*{Stock}\label{stock}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock}

This assessment reports the status of the Yellowtail Rockfish
(\emph{Sebastes flavidus}) resource in U.S. waters off the coast of the
California, Oregon, and Washington using data through 2016.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) manages the U.S. fishery
as two stocks separated at Cape Mendocino, California (40\(^\circ\)
10'N). The northern stock has long been assessed on its own; the
southern stock is treated as part of the Southern Shelf Complex. This
assessment analyzes each stock independently, with the southern stock
extending southward to the U.S./Mexico border and the northern stock
extending northward to the U.S./Canada border.

The most recent fully integrated assessment (Wallace and Lai
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wallace2005}{2005}), following the pattern of
prior assessments, included only the Northern stock which it divided
into three assessment areas with divisions at Cape Elizabeth
(47\(^\circ\) 20'N) and Cape Falcon (45\(^\circ\) 46'N). A data-moderate
assessment conducted in 2013 (Cope et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cope2013}{2013}) was the first to analyze the
southern stock, determining its contribution to the overfishing limit
(OFL) for the Southern Shelf Complex.

Since the 2005 assessment, reconstruction of historical catch by
Washington and Oregon makes any border but the state line (roughly
46\(^\circ\) N) incompatible with the data from those states.
Additionally, much of the groundfish catch landed in northern Oregon is
caught in Washington waters.

This assessment addresses the stock in two areas consistent with the
management border at Cape Mendocino. This is consistent, as well, with a
recent genetic analysis (Hess et al. n.d.) that found distinct stocks
north and south of Cape Mendocino but did not find stock differences
within the northern area.

\subsection*{Catches}\label{catches}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Catches}

Catches from the Northern stock were divided into four categories:
commercial catch, bycatch in the at-sea hake fishery, recreational catch
in Oregon and California (north of 40\(^\circ\) 10'N), and recreational
catch in Washington. The first three of these fleets were entered in
metric tons, but the recreational catch from Washington was entered in
the model as numbers of fish with the average weight calculated
internally in the model from the weight-length relationship and the
length-compositions.

Catches from the Southern stock were divided into two categories:
commercial and recreational catch, both of which were entered as metric
tons.

\subsection*{Data and Assessment}\label{data-and-assessment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and Assessment}

\hl{Include: date of last assessment, type of assessment model, data available, new 
information, and information lacking.}

Yellowtail Rockfish was assessed north of Cape Mendocino in 2005 in a
fully integrated age-based assessment. A 2013 data-moderate assessment
was the first to address the southern stock (Cope et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cope2013}{2013}).

This assessment uses Stock Synthesis version 3.3. The Northern model
begins in 1889, with the assumption that the stock was at
\hl{an unfished equilibrium that year?} The Southern model begins in
1916, with the assumption that the stock was at
\hl{an unfished equilibrium that year?}

This stock assessment estimates that Yellowtail Rockfish in the Northern
model are above the biomass target, but above the minimum stock size
threshold. \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} The estimated
relative depletion level for \hl{Model 1} in 2016 is 56.7\%
(\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 45.4\%-68.1\%,
corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 8.18588 trillion eggs
(\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic interval: 5.9-10.47 trillion eggs) of
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).
Unfished age 4+ biomass was estimated to be 132.7 mt in the base case
model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target
(\(SB_{40\%}\)) is 5.8 trillion eggs, which gives a catch of 4116.9 mt.
Equilibrium yield at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\) harvest rate corresponding to
\(SPR_{50\%}\) is 3882.8 mt.

This stock assessment estimates that Yellowtail Rockfish in the Southern
model are above the biomass target, but above the minimum stock size
threshold. \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} The estimated
relative depletion level for \hl{Model 2} in 2016 is 98\%

corresponding to an unfished spawning output of 5.68452 trillion eggs
(\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic interval: ) of spawning output in the
base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod2}). Unfished age 4+ biomass was
estimated to be 117.6 mt in the base case model. The target spawning
output based on the biomass target (\(SB_{40\%}\)) is 2.3 trillion eggs,
which gives a catch of mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\)
harvest rate corresponding to \(SPR_{50\%}\) is 3136.4 mt.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Basic Information}\label{basic-information}

Yellowtail rockfish, \emph{Sebastes flavidus}, occur off the West Coast
of the United States from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.
Yellowtail is a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from
Central California to British Columbia (Love
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}). Because it is an aggregating,
midwater species it is usually caught between 60 and 120 fathoms in the
commercial midwater trawl fishery. In California there is a large
recreational fishery as well. The center of yellowtail rockfish
abundance is from southern Oregon through British Columbia (Fraidenburg
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fraidenburg1980}{1980}).

Once thought to comprise a single stock, a recent genetic study has
shown that there are in fact two sub-species, with a genetic cline at
Cape Mendocino, California, roughly \(40^\circ 10^\prime\) North
Latitude (Hess et al. n.d.). The species has never had a full length and
age integrated assessment south of Cape Mendocino, mainly due to a lack
of fishery-independent data; this assessment represents the first
attempt to do so.

Yellowtail rockfish are colloquially known as ``greenies'', although
\emph{flavidus} is Latin for ``yellow'' (Love
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}). We have summarized yellowtail
rockfish life history, fisheries, assessment and management here, but
in-depth, extensive background information on yellowtail and other
managed species is available at (Council
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2016}{2016}).

\subsection{Map}\label{map}

A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for
fisheries or data collection strata is provided in Figure
\ref{fig:boundary_map}.

\subsection{Life History}\label{life-history}

Rockfish are in general long-lived and slow-growing, however yellowtail
rockfish have a high growth rate relative to other rockfish species,
reaching a maximum size of about 55 cm in approximately 15 years (Tagart
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1991}{1991}). Yellowtail can live at least
64 years (Love \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}). Yellowtail
rockfish are among those that are fertilized internally and release live
young. Spawning aggregations occur in the fall, and parturition in the
winter and spring (January-May) (Eldridge et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eldridge1991}{1991}). Young-of-the-year recruit
to nearshore waters from April through August, migrating to deeper water
in the fall. Preferred habitat is the midwater over reefs and boulder
fields.

Yellowtail rockfish are extremely motile, and make rapid and frequent
ascents and descents of 40 meters; they also exhibit strong homing
tendencies (Love \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}). They are able
to quickly release gas from their swim bladders, perhaps making them
less susceptible to barotrauma than similar species (Eldridge et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eldridge1991}{1991}).

Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) have been closed to fishing since
2002. Following that closure, Yellowtail rockfish are among the many
species that have been seen to increase in both abundance and in average
size in Central California (Marks et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Marks2015}{2015}).

\subsection{Fishery and Management
History}\label{fishery-and-management-history}

The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast first developed off
California in the late 19th century as a hook-and-line fishery (Love et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}). The rockfish trawl fishery
was established in the early 1940s, when the United States became
involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created an
increased demand for other sources of protein (Harry and Morgan
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Harry1961}{1961}, Alverson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Alverson1964}{1964}).

Until late 2002, yellowtail rockfish were harvested as part of a
directed mid-water trawl fishery, with fairly high landings in the 1980s
and 1990s. Yellowtail commonly co-occur with canary, widow rockfish and
several other rockfishes (Tagart
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1988}{1988}); (Rogers and Pikitch
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rogers1992}{1992}). Association with these and
other rockfish species has substantially altered fishing opportunity for
yellowtail rockfish since canary rockfish stocks were declared
overfished by National Marine Fisheries service in 2000. In order to
achieve the necessary reduction in the canary rockfish catch, stringent
management measures were adopted, limiting harvest of yellowtail
rockfish as well as other co-occurring species.

Beginning in 2000, shelf rockfish species could no longer be retained by
vessels using bottom trawl footropes with a diameter greater than 8
inches. The use of small footrope gear increases the risk of gear loss
in rocky areas. This restriction was intended to provide an incentive
for fishers to avoid high-relief, rocky habitat, thus reducing the
exposure of many depleted species to trawling. This was reinforced
through reductions in landing limits for most shelf rockfish species.

Since September 2002, Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs, areas known to
be critical habitat) have been closed to fishing. Alongside these
closures, limits on landings have been in place that were designed so as
to accommodate incidental bycatch only. These eliminated directed
mid-water fishing opportunities for yellowtail rockfish in non-tribal
trawl fisheries. A somewhat greater opportunity to target yellowtail
rockfish in the trawl fishery has been available since 2011 under the
trawl rationalization program, however quotas for widow and canary
rockfish continue to constrain targeting of yellowtail rockfish. With
the recent improved status of constraining stocks, the industry is
developing strategies to better attain allocations of yellowtail and
widow rockfish.

Yellowtail rockfish are currently managed with stock-specific harvest
specifications north of \(40^\circ 10^\prime\) N. latitude, and as part
of the Southern Shelf Rockfish complex south of \(40^\circ 10^\prime\)
N. latitude. The Over Fishing Limit (OFL) contribution of yellowtail
rockfish to the Southern Shelf Rockfish complex is based on a
data-moderate analysis (Cope et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cope2013}{2013}).

\subsection{Assessment History}\label{assessment-history}

Early studies of yellowtail stocks on the U.S. West Coast north of
\(40^\circ 10^\prime\) N. latitude (Cape Mendocino, northern California)
began in the 1980s with observational surveys. Statistical assessments
of yellowtail rockfish were conducted in 1982 (Tagart
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1982}{1982}), 1988 (Tagart
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1988}{1988}), 1996 (Tagart et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1997}{1997}), and 1997 (Tagart et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart1997}{1997}) to determine harvest
specifications for the stock. These early assessments employed a variety
of statistical methods, for example, the 1997 assessment used cohort
analysis and dynamic pool modeling.

The yellowtail assessment in 2000 (Tagart et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart2000}{2000}) was the first that estimated
stock status, with an estimated depletion of 60.5 percent at the start
of 2000. Lai et al. (Lai et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lai2003}{2003})
updated the 2000 assessment and estimated that stock depletion was 46
percent at the start of 2003. A second assessment update was prepared in
2005 (Wallace and Lai \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wallace2005}{2005}) with an
estimated depletion of 55 percent at the start of 2005. The 2000
assessment and updates were age-structured assessments conducted using
AD Model Builder as the software platform for nonlinear optimization
(Fournier et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Fournier2012}{2012}).

A data-moderate assessment of yellowtail rockfish south of
\(40^\circ 10^\prime\) N. latitude was conducted in 2013 (Cope et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cope2013}{2013}). This assessment estimated
depletion at the start of 2013 at 67 percent, and estimated the spawning
biomass at 50,043 mt. This was a large biomass increase relative to
previous estimates and may be attributed to the low removals over the
previous decade.

\subsection{Fisheries off Canada, Alaska, and/or
Mexico}\label{fisheries-off-canada-alaska-andor-mexico}

The 2015 Stock Assessment conducted by the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans (DFO) found the stock to be at 0.49B0, in the ``healthy'' range.

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center assesses yellowtail rockfish as one
of 25 species in the ``Other Rockfish'' complex in the Gulf of Alaska.
The 2015 full assessment of this complex found no evidence of
overfishing, which is confirmed in the 2016 SAFE document(Center
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AFSC2016}{2016}).

Limited catches yellowtail are reported as far south as Baja
California(Love \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}).

\section{Data}\label{data}

Data used in the Northern and Southern yellowtail rockfish assessments
are summarized in Figures \ref{fig:data_plot} and \ref{fig:data_plot}.

Data sources for the two models are largely distinct. Northern fisheries
and surveys had very sparse data (if any) for the south and vice-versa.
Among the 12 data sources referenced below, only 2 data sources are
common to both models. These are the MRFSS/RecFIN recreational dockside
survey, which focuses on California and Oregon, and the CalCOM
California commercial dataset, which contributed data from the
northern-most California counties (Eureka and Del Norte) to the Northern
model. The CalCOM data account for less than five percent of the
commercial landings in the Northern model, and less than 1\% of the
biological samples.

Commercial landings are not differentiated in either model. For the
Northern model, this is due to the very small portion (1.15 \%) of the
landings that are attributed to non-trawl gear. For the Southern model,
this is due to the paucity of data.

A description of each model's data sources follows.

\subsubsection{Commercial Fishery
Landings}\label{commercial-fishery-landings}

\textbf{Washington and Oregon Landings} The bulk of the commercial
landings for Washington and Oregon came from the from the Pacific
Fisheries Information Network (\textbf{PacFIN}) database.

\textbf{Washington Catch Information}\\
The Washington Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (\textbf{WDFW})
provided historical yellowtail catch for 1889--1980. Landings for
1981-2016 came from the PacFIN database. WDFW also provided catches for
the period 1981 -- 2016 to include the re-distribution of the
unspeciated ``URCK'' landings in PacFIN; this information is currently
not available from PacFIN.

\textbf{Oregon Catch Information}\\
The Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (\textbf{ODFW}) provided
historical yellowtail catch from 1892-1985. ODFW also provided estimates
of yellowtail rockfish in the in the un-speciated PacFIN ``URCK'' and
``POP1'' catch categories for recent years, and those estimates were
combined with PacFIN landings for 1986-2016.

\textbf{Northern California Catch}\\
The California Commercial Fishery Database (\textbf{CalCOM}) provided
landings for the Northern model for the two counties north of
\(40^\circ 10^\prime\) (Eureka and Del Norte) for 1969-2016.

\textbf{Hake Bycatch}\\
The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (\textbf{AFSC}) provided data for
yellowtail bycatch in the hake fishery from 1976-2016.

\subsubsection{Sport Fishery Removals}\label{sport-fishery-removals}

\textbf{Washington Sport Catch}\\
WDFW provided recreational catches for 1967 and 1975-2016.

\textbf{Oregon Sport Catch}\\
ODFW provided recreational catch data for 1979-2016.

\textbf{MRFSS and RecFIN} Data from Northern California came from the
Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (\textbf{MRFSS}) and
from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (\textbf{RecFIN}).
These are dockside surveys focused on California and Oregon. MRFSS was
conducted from 1980-1989 and 1993-2003, RecFIN from 2004 to the present.

\subsubsection{Estimated Discards}\label{estimated-discards}

\textbf{Commercial Discards}\\
The West Coast Groundfish Observing Program (\textbf{WCGOP}) is an
onboard observer program that has extensively surveyed fishing practices
since 2002, with nearly 100\% observer coverage in the trawl sector in
recent years. WCGOP provided discard ratios for yellowtail rockfish from
2002 to 2015.

\textbf{Pikitch Study}\\
The Pikitch study was conducted between 1985 and 1987 (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pikitch1988}{1988}). The northern and southern
boundaries of the study were \(48^\circ 42^\prime\) N latitude and
\(42^\circ 60^\prime\) N. latitude respectively, which is primarily
within the Columbia INPFC area (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pikitch1988}{1988} , Rogers and Pikitch
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rogers1992}{1992}).

Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using
bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers of normal fishing
operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total
weight of the catch by tow and recorded the weight of species retained
and discarded in the sample.

Pikitch study discards were aggregated due to small sample size and
included in the data as representing a single year mid-way through the
study.

\subsubsection{Abundance Indices}\label{abundance-indices}

\textbf{Commercial Logbook CPUE}\\
The commercial logbook (fish-ticket) data in PacFIN was used to generate
an index for the years 1987-1998, a period in which management of the
fishery was stable, i.e., regulations weren``t changing fishery
practices.

The data were modeled with a modified Stephens-MacCall approach
(Stephens and MacCall \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stephens2004}{2004}). This
approach uses the species composition of the catch to evaluate the
per-haul probability of encountering a particular species; in this case,
yellowtail rockfish. The intent of the analysis is to eliminate all
hauls from the index that could not encounter yellowtail.

Usually, the Stephens-MacCall approach is a simple binomial model for
presence-absence of the predictive species and the target, however a
generalized linear mixed-effects approach -- modeling the species as
binomial and adding random effects for the interaction of year and
vessel, for haul duration, and for month improved the model fit.

The hauls identified with a reasonable probability of encountering
yellowtail were then modeled in a delta-lognormal glm to produce an
annual index of abundance, bootstrapped 500 times to evaluate
uncertainty.

\textbf{Hake Bycatch Index}

The Hake bycatch data provided by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center
(AFSC) was used to generate an index of abundance for 1985-1999.

Data on haul-by-haul catch of Yellowtail Rockfish and Pacific Hake for
the period 1976-2016 were obtained from the At-Sea Hake Observer Program
along associated information including the location of each tow and the
duration. Previous Yellowtail assessments used an index of abundance for
the years 1978-1999. The most recent assessment (Wallace and Lai, 2005)
stated that the index was not updated to include years beyond 1999
``because subsequent changes in fishery regulations and behavior have
altered the statistical properties of these abundance indices''. The
ending year of 1999 was retained for this analysis. However, the years
up to 1984 have relatively few tows with adequate information for CPUE
analysis, and fishing effort off the coast of Washington where
yellowtail are most commonly encountered (Figure \ref{fig:ASHOP_X1}).
Therefore, for this new analysis, 1985 was chosen as the starting year.

The hake fishery was evolving during the chosen 15 year period
(1985-1999), which included a transition from foreign to domestic fleets
fishing for Pacific Hake (Figure \ref{fig:ASHOP_X2}). The index from the
at-sea hake fishery used in previous assessments standardized for
changes in catchability by using a ratio estimator relating yellowtail
catch to hake catch and then scaling by an estimate of fishing effort
for hake (Equation 1 in Wallace and Lai, 2005). However, that approach
does not take into account differences in the spatial distribution of
the at-sea hake fishery relative to the distributions of hake and
yellowtail.

For this new analysis, changes in catchability were estimated by
comparing an index based on a geostatistical analysis of the hake CPUE
from VAST (Thorson et al. YYYY) to the estimated available hake biomass
from the most recent stock assessment (Berger et al. 2017). The relative
catchability was then used to adjust an independent geostatistical index
of yellowtail CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:ASHOP_X3}). In order to capture the
general trend in catchability, reducing the variability among years,
linear, exponential, and locally smoothed (LOWESS) models were fit to
the time series of individual estimates of hake index to available
biomass (lower panel in Figure \ref{fig:ASHOP_X3}). Of these, the LOWESS
model best captured the pattern of fastest change in the middle of the
time series. The average rate of increase in the resulting estimated
catchability time series is 13\% per year.

VAST was then used to conduct a geostatistical standardization of the
CPUE of yellowtail caught as bycatch in the at-sea hake fishery. The
resulting yellowtail index after adjustment by the estimated changes in
catchability is qualitatively more similar to the index used in previous
assessments (Figure \ref{fig:ASHOP_X4}) than the index resulting from
assuming constant catchability.

\subsubsection{Fishery-Independent Data}\label{fishery-independent-data}

\textbf{Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) shelf-slope survey}

This survey, referred to as the \textbf{NWFSCcombo Survey}, has been
conducted annually starting in 2003. It uses a random-grid design
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m from
late-May to early-October (\hl{add reference: Bradburn 2011}). Four
chartered industry vessels are used each year (with the exception of
2013 when the U.S. federal government shutdown curtailed the survey).

The data from the NWFSCcombo survey was analyzed using a spatio-temporal
delta-model (\hl{add reference: Thorson2015}), implemented as an R
package VAST (\hl{add reference: Thorson2017}) and publicly available
online (\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST}). Spatial and
spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter
probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter
probability, and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year
effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in
the database.

Both lognormal and gamma distributions were explored for the positive
tows and produced similar results with the lognormal model showing
better patterns in Q-Q plot. The index shows variability with an overall
gradual increase from 2003 to 2013 with high estimates near the end of
the time series in 2014 and 2016. A design-based index extrapolated from
swept area densities without any geostatistical standardization shows a
more dramatic increase from 2015 to 2016.

Length and age compositions were also developed from this survey.

\textbf{Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Triennial shelf survey}

The \textbf{Triennial Survey} was conducted by the AFSC every third year
between 1977 and 2001, (and was conducted in 2004 by the NWFSC using the
same protocols). The 1977 survey had incomplete coverage and is not
believe to be comparable to the later years. The survey design used
equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific
depth range were initiated. The depth range and latitudinal range was
not consistent across years, but all years in the period 1980-2004
included the area from 40\(^\circ\) 10'N north to the Canadian border
and a depth range that included 55-366 meters, which spans the range
where the vast majority of Yellowtail encountered in all trawl surveys.
Therefore the index was based on this depth range.

An index of abundance was estimated based on the VAST delta-GLMM model
as described for the NWFSCcombo Index above. In this case as well, Q-Q
plots indicated slightly better performance of the lognormal over gamma
models for positive tows. The index shows a gradual decline from 1980 to
1992 followed by high variability in the final 4 points spanning
1995-2004.

\subsubsection{Biological Samples}\label{biological-samples}

\textbf{Length And Age Compositions}\\
Length composition data were compiled from PacFIN for Oregon and
Washington for the Northern model and combined with raw (unexpanded)
length data from CalCOM for the two California counties north of
40\(^\circ\) 10'N (Eureka and Del Norte counties).

\subsection{Biological Parameters Common to Both
Models}\label{biological-parameters-common-to-both-models}

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Aging Precision And Bias}

Age error matrices were developed for double-reads at the PFMC aging lab
in Newport, OR and for double reads within the WDFW aging lab. The
Newport lab has done all of the Survey aging for the NWFSC, along with
some commercial ages and the 400 fish from the Small Study. WDFW
provided the bulk of recreational and commercial ages. Between-lab
differences in aging were minute, as were within-lab differences. This
result is supported by the primary age reader's assessment: yellowtail
rockfish are extremely easy to age (B. Kamikawa, pers. comm.).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Weight-Length}

The weight-length relationship is based on the standard power function:
\(W = \alpha(L^\beta)\) where \(W\) is individual weight (kg), \(L\) is
length (cm), and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are coefficients used as
constants.

To estimate this relationship, 12,778 samples with both weight and
length measurements from the fishery independent surveys were analyzed.
These included 6,354 samples from the NWFSC Combo survey, 5,085 from the
Triennial survey, and 1,339 from the Hook and Line survey. All Hook and
Line survey samples were from the Southern area, along with 910 samples
from the other two surveys (Figure \ref{fig:weight-length}).

A single weight-length relationship was chosen for females and males in
both areas after examining various factors that may influence this
relationships, including sex, area, year, and season. None of these
factors had a strong influence in the overall results. Season was one of
the bigger factors, with fish sampled later in the year showing a small
increase in weight at a given length (2-6\% depending on the other
factors considered). However, season was confounded with area because
most of the samples from the Southern area were collected from the Hook
and Line survey which takes place later in the year (mid-September to
mid-November) and the resolution of other data in the model do not
support modeling the stock at a scale finer than a annual time step.

Males and females did not show strong differences in either area, and
the estimated differences were in opposite directions for the two areas,
suggesting that this might be a spurious relationship or confounded with
differences timing of the sampling relative to spawning.

The estimated coefficients resulting from this analysis were
\(\alpha = 1.1843e-05\) and \(\beta = 3.0672\).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Maturity And Fecundity} Maturity was estimated from histological
analysis of

141 samples collected in 2016. These include 96 from the NWFSC Combo
survey, 25 from mid-water catches in the NWFSC acoustic/trawl survey, 13
from the Hook and Line survey, and 7 from Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife. The sample sizes were not adequate to estimate differences in
maturity by area. Length at 50\% maturity was estimated at 42.49cm
(Figure \ref{fig:maturity.png}) which was consistent with the range
37-45cm cited in the previous assessment (Wallace and Lai
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wallace2005}{2005}).

\textbf{Natural Mortality}

Natural mortality estimates were provided by Owen Hamel (pers. comm.).

\textbf{Sex ratios}

males. The sex ratio falls off differently in each model, as can be seen
in Figs(x,y).

\section{Assessment}\label{assessment}

\subsection{History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This
Stock}\label{history-of-modeling-approaches-used-for-this-stock}

Yellowtail rockfish was previously modeled as ag age-structured, 3-area
stock north of \(40^\circ 10^\prime\) in 1999 (Tagart et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tagart2000}{2000}) using a model written in ADMB
(Fournier et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Fournier2012}{2012}); an update
of this assessment was last conducted in 2004 (Wallace and Lai
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wallace2005}{2005}). That assessment divided the
stock into 3 INPFC areas which are not coincident with state boundaries;
this is a concern in that recent reconstructions of historical catch are
state-by-state along the West Coast. Because we cannot produce data that
conform to the areas previously assessed, we have made no effort to
reproduce the previous model.

A data-moderate approach was used to evaluate stock status in 2013 (Cope
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Cope2013}{2013}). This approach is not
compatible with the current model, and we have made no attempt to
reproduce it.

\subsubsection{Previous Assessment
Recommendations}\label{previous-assessment-recommendations}

Many of the recommendations of the previous STAR panel are not relevant
to this assessment, as they related to data deficiencies at that time
that have since been resolved. The 2004 STAR particularly recommended a
focus on abundance indices, which they noted might require further
survey information.

This assessment provides four indices for the Northern model, and three
for the Southern model. All indices are newly developed for this
analysis.

\clearpage
\newpage

\subsection{Model Description}\label{model-description}

\subsubsection{Transition To The Current Stock
Assessment}\label{transition-to-the-current-stock-assessment}

These are the main changes from the previous model, and our rationale
for them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Transition to Stock Synthesis. \emph{Rationale}: The Pacific Fishery
  Management Council's preferred modeling platform for stock assessments
  is Stock Synthesis (Methot \protect\hyperlink{ref-Methot2015}{2015}),
  developed since the last full assessment of yellowtail rockfish.
\item
  Addition of Southern model. \emph{Rationale}: Hess, et al. determined
  that the West Coast yellowtail stocks show a genetic cline occurring
  near Cape Mendocino, which is roughly \(40^\circ 10^\prime\) north
  latitude (Hess et al. n.d.). This divides the stock into two
  genetically distinct substocks which we model independently.
\item
  Availability of recent data. \emph{Rationale}: Ten years of data
  collection have occurred since the last update assessment, and the
  data necessary for an assessment of the Southern stock is now
  available.
\item
  Historical catch reconstructions. \emph{Rationale}: Reconstruction of
  catch timeseries in California, Washington and Oregon clarify stock
  history as far back as 1889.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Definition of Fleets and
Areas}\label{definition-of-fleets-and-areas}

The Northern model comprises the area between Cape Mendocino,
California, and the Canadian border. The Southern model runs from Cape
Mendocino to the Mexican border.

\textbf{Northern Model}

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of bottom and
midwater trawl. No attempt was made to analyze the fishery separately by
gear, particularly since it seems that in the fishery in the 1980s and
1990s, ``bottom trawl'' gear was used in the midwater as well as on the
bottom, and ``midwater gear'' was sometimes dragged across soft bottom
(Craig Goode, ODFW Port Sampler, pers. comm).

The data associated with the commercial fleet includes age- and
length-composition data from PacFIN and CalCOM, historical catch
timeseries from CDFW, ODFW and WDFW, and observations from the West
Coast Groundfish Observing Program (\textbf{WCGOP}), which documents
discarding in the commercial fishery (providing discard lengths), as
well as discard rates calculated from WCGOP data. Sex was available for
the comps in the retained catch, which is by-sex in the model, but was
not available for the discards, so they are undifferentiated by sex.

The PacFIN logbook (fish ticket) index developed for the commercial
fishery is in fish/tow.

\emph{At-Sea Hake Fishery}: Yellowtail Rockfish are frequently caught in
mid-water trawls associated with the At-Sea Hake Fishery (consisting of
the Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors). These catches are
recorded and biological sampling takes place but the fish are processed
at sea (typically into fish meal) and are not included in the PacFIN
database, so this fishery requires separate analysis. The At-Sea Hake
fishery provides catches, length compositions by sex, and an index of
abundance.

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport
fisheries off Oregon, and northern California (Eureka and Del Norte
counties), from MRFSS and RecFIN. The index of abundance for the
recreational fleet is in fish per angler-hour. Length data for this
fleet are undifferentiated by sex.

\emph{Washington-Sport}: The Washington data (WA\_Sport) provides
catches, lengths and ages, and was treated as a separate fleet for two
reasons: first, the length composition of the Washington catches were
different from those in the recreational landings in Oregon and northern
California (MRFSS/RecFIN data). There are very large fish in this
dataset, and fewer small ones. Second, the WA\_Sport landings are not
available by weight, so they are entered in the model as numbers, and
Stock Synthesis internally converts them to weight, using the
percentages-at-length and the Weight-Length relationship. Sex was
available for the biological data, however many lengthed fish were not
sexed, so the lengths for this fleet are undifferentiated by sex,
although the ages are.

\emph{Research}: Research fleets (3). The Alaska Fisheries Science
Center's \textbf{Triennial} Trawl survey, and the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center's \textbf{NWFSCcombo} survey each provide age- and
length-compositions, as well as an index of abundance.

The remaining research fleet is the \textbf{Pikitch study}, which
provides discard length-compositions and an index of abundance.

\emph{Conditional Age-at-Length}: Only the NWFSCcombo ages were used as
conditional age-at-length in the model. All other aged fleets
(Commercial, Washington\_Sport, and Triennial) are present in the model
as marginal ages due to the amount of noise in the age data for those
fleets.

\emph{Indices}: Fish per angler-hour is the basis for the
Washington\_Sport and Pikitch indices. The NWFSCcombo and Triennial
surveys provide indices based on fish per area-towed. The logbook survey
for the commercial fleet is in units of fish per tow.

\textbf{Southern Model}

\emph{Commercial}: The commercial fleet consists primarily of hook and
line and trawl gear. Hook and line gear account for 78\% of the landings
by weight in the recent period (1978-2016). Commercial data were sexed,
although there are many unsexed lengths. To preserve the large numbers
of lengths, the length data are entered in the model as
undifferentiated, however the ages are sexed and provide the sole
conditional age-at-length timeseries in the Southern Model.

\emph{Recreational}: The recreational fleet includes data from sport
fishery off the California coast south of Cape Mendocino. The
recreational lengths are unsexed. The index is in fish per angler\_hour.

\emph{California Onbord Recreational Survey}: Research derived-data
include observations from the California Onboard recreational survey.
The length-compositions from this survey are undifferentiated by sex.
The index is in fish per angler\_hour.

\emph{NWFSC Hook-and-Line Survey}: The data from this survey are used in
the model as an index of fish per angler\_hour, a single year of
marginal age data by sex, and sexed length compositions.

\emph{Small Fish Study}: A separate index, length comps and a single
year of ages reflect a small study of juvenile fish conducted by the
SWFSC.

\subsubsection{Modeling Software}\label{modeling-software}

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3(Methot
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Methot2015}{2015}), which is the Pacific Fishery
Management Council's preferred modeling platform for assessments.

\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}

Commercial and survey length composition and marginal age composition
data are weighted according to the method of Ian Stewart (pers.comm):

Sample Size = 0.138 * Nfish + Ntows if Nfish/Ntows \textless{} 44, and
Ntows * 7.06 otherwise.

Age-at-Length samples are unwieghted; that is, each fish is assumed to
represent an independent sample.

Recreational trips (the analogue of tows in the commercial fishery) are
difficult to define in most cases. Since much of the recreational data
are from the dockside interview MRFSS program, which didn't anticipate
the need to delineate samples as belonging to particular trips, we chose
to use all recreational data ``as-is'', with the initial weights entered
as number of fish.

Weighting among fleets uses either the Francis method (Francis
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Francis2011}{2011}) or the Ianelli-McAllister
harmonic mean method (McAllister and Ianelli
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McAllister1997}{1997}). The Francis method was
used for all fleets, except for the age data from the Southern model's
Hook and Line survey, which is a single year of data to which we applied
the Ianelli-McAllister method.

\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}

Natural Mortality (M) priors were provided by Owen Hamel (Hamel
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hamel2015}{2015}). Natural mortality priors were
based on examination of the 99\% quantile of the observed ages from
early in the time-series, before the full impact of fishing would have
taken place. For the Northern model, these quantiles were approximately
35 years for females and 45 years for males, resulting in median M
values of 0.15 and 0.12 for females and males. For the Southern model,
the 99\% quantile of the early age observations were approximately 30
and 40 years for females and males, resulting in median M prior values
of 0.18 and 0.135, respectively. In both models, M for males was
represented as an offset from females. In the Northern model, both the
female value and the male offset could be estimated without priors so
the priors were not used. For the southern model, M was fixed at the
median prior values for the two sexes.

The prior for steepness (h, 0.718) was provided by James Thorson and
used as a fixed parameter in both models. \textless{}TOADS:

\subsection{Model Selection and
Evaluation}\label{model-selection-and-evaluation}

\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural
Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}

Selectivity in both models is asymptotic, with the exception of the
OR-CA MRFSS recreational fleet in the Northern model, and the Onboard
recreational fleet in the Southern model.

\subsubsection{Alternate Models
Considered}\label{alternate-models-considered}

Time-blocked selectivity and retention were investigated in the Northern
model, as were domed selectivities.

We also explored time-blocks on selectivity in the Southern model, and
domed selectivity for the MRFSS/RecFIN data.

These approaches resulted in model fits to data that were obviously
poor, and so they were rejected

\subsubsection{Convergence}\label{convergence}

Convergence testing through use of dispersed starting values often
requires extreme values to explore new areas of the multivariate
likelihood surface. Stock Synthesis provides a jitter option that
generates random starting values from a normal distribution logistically
transformed into each parameter's range (Methot
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Methot2015}{2015}). We used this function to find
parameter values for convergence in the Southern model. The Northern
model did not require jittering.

 \#\# Northern Model Base Case Results

\subsubsection{Indices and Discards}\label{indices-and-discards}

Selectivities in the Northern model \ref{fig:selex_model1} shows the
difference between the recreational fisheries and the commercial fishery
and survey sampling. All of the fish are fully selected by 50 cm, but
the recreational fish are fully selected at 30 cm.

Retention by length \ref{fig: retention_model1} varies over time between
40\% and 100\%, with no clear pattern of interannual variation, except
for the trawl-rationalization era 2011-present.

Discarding in the commercial fleet \ref{fig:r4ss_discard_model1} is fit
only by putting blocks on retention in the Northern model. Discards were
very low except during the 1990s and 2000s, until the
trawl-rationalization program implementation.

Fits to the indices for the northern model demonstrate the utility of
the NWFSCcombo survey. Although the model misses the uptick at the end
of the timeseries, it is the only recent index and is well-fit by the
model. The other indices are noisier. Most of the indices are fairly
flat, indicating little change in abundance during each time-period.
Although the fit to the Triennial index is poor, the data nicely
reflects the changes in management during it's tenure: the CPUE was
falling during the 1980s and 1990s, then rising after stringent
restrictions began in 2000.

\subsubsection{Lengths}\label{lengths}

Bubble plots for the lengths in the fishery
\ref{fig:comp_length_bubble_mod1_page1} show the constancy of the
commercial fleet, and the differences in growth between males and
females; the females are larger, the males smaller. The recreational
fleet is represented by two different sampling regimes, and the
changeover in the mid-2000s is clear in that panel. That the WA\_Sport
fishery catches larger fish is represented in the large bubbles at the
top of the panel. Had we examined that fishery earlier in the process of
putting the model together, we might have settled on a larger maximum
size bin, however that fishery remains the smallest portion of the
catches.

Commercial length comps are very well fit \ref{fig:xxx}, and
\ref{fig:mod1_5_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_xxx}. Commercial discards are
noiser and not well fit \ref{fig:mod1_6_comp_lenfxxx}. The panel
describing the combined fits and data weighting for the commercial
fishery is duplicted, need to remove redundant figure.

Lengths in the early period of the Hake Bycatch fishery are noisy
(doubtless due to small sample sizes). By 1992, the model is able to fit
the data well \ref{fig:mod1_10_comp_xxx}.
\ref{fig:mod1_13_comp_lenfit_data_weighting} shows that the fits in the
early period have twice (at last) the uncertainty of the later period.

The recreation OR+N.CA timeseries of lengths demonstrates the difference
between the MRFSS sampling and RecFIN sampling. The fits in the early
period are good, those in the later period are noisy and model
uncertainty is high \ref{fig:mod1_14_comp_l} and \ref{}

The WA\_Sport length fits might have been improved with a better choice
of maximum size bin for the model \ref{fig:mod1_18_comp_lenf};
\ref{fig:mod1_21_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Recreational} however
the data are noisy throughout the size range represented.

The Trinnial lengths \ref{fig:mod1_22_comp_len} and
\ref{fig:mod1_25_comp_lenfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_Triennial Survey} are
fit well in some years and not in others. The data is not noisy, however
the intermittency of data collection may mean that the model is unable
to capture interannual variation as well as for an annual timeseries.

NWFSCcombo lengths are not well fit, particularly in 2013, where the
data show a large number of small fit that may represent a good
recruitment several years earlier \ref{fig:mod1_26_comp_len} and
\ref{fig:mod1_29_comp_lenfit_data_weighting}.

\ref{fig:mod1_30_comp_lenfit__aggregated_across_time} shows the relative
fits among the data sources. The timeseries of presence-absence
residuals indicated by filled- and open-bubbles
\ref{fig:comp_Pearson_length_mod1_page1} and
\ref{fig:comp_Pearson_length_mod1_page2} demonstrates the relative
disappointment in model fits; the smaller the bubble, the better the
match between the data and the model expectation.

\subsubsection{Ages}\label{ages}

The NWFSCcombo survey provided the only source of conditional
age-at-length data for the Northern model; ages for other fleets were
treated as marginal ages.

\subsection{Southern Model}\label{southern-model}

One thing to point out is that although the scale of the biomass in the
model is somewhat sensitive to various data sources, the depletion is
not. In tuning the model we were suprised to note that depletion always
stayed above 80\%.

\section{Regional Management
Considerations}\label{regional-management-considerations}

Management of the yellowtail rockfish northern stock has always been
delineated by the 40\(^\circ\) 10' line and the Canadian border. That
the stock's genetic cline was found at Cape Mendocino is a happy
accident that reinforces 40\(^\circ\) 10' as the appropriate management
line.

This assessment was not designed to test that choice. Given that the
data for commercial and recreational fisheries is collected by the
individual states (WA, OR, CA), it might have been interesting to
investigate a management line at the California/Oregon border, had the
STAT team the time and managers the interest in investigating a change.

\newpage

\section{Research Needs}\label{research-needs}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A longer timeseries of the juvenile rockfish CPUE in the south.

\item A commercial index in the north.  This is by far the largest segment of the fishery, and the introduction of trawl rationalization program should mean that an index can be developed for the current fishery when the next assessment is performed.

\item More recent ages for the southern model.  The commercial age timeseries currently stops in 2002.
